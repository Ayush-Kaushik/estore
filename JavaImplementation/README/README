LIMITATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* If the user leaves the price blank then following message appears: 
			*** Enter numbers values only ***

* I am not sure if it counts as limitation because leaving price blank will actually make the price equal to 0.00 . Its just that this message appears.

* Only the main command loop (Welcome to EStoreSearch) has the option to perform action by typing the command itself, for the rest of the loops user has to enter the number corresponding to the option.

* If user wants to add 0.00 as the price of the item, then don’t type it in 0.00 and press Enter. Instead leave it blank and program will input 0.00 by itself.

* I have commented out some code chunks and print statements used solely for testing. In case program does not works as expected. Kindly read those for part marks. Thanks.

* try and catch methodology have not been used for error checking in some methods, this is because I reused those methods from my previous assignment.
