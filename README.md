# Basic CRM RoadMap (Spring Boot)

## Stage 1
* [ ] Setup directory structure for Java application
* [ ] Set up gradle (document the setup process)
* [ ] Add a test endpoint
* [ ] Document the entire process in wiki page of this repository
* [ ] Setup a simple database table
* [ ] Make connection to the database
* [ ] Understand components of Spring-bbot application
* [ ] Connect this to Github actions to build an executable (https://tomgregory.com/build-gradle-projects-with-github-actions/) - Document this process

```
Schema:
CustomerID,
Name,
Country,
City,
Address,
Phone Number,
Email Address
```

## Stage 2:
* [ ] Create CRUD based endpoints and send test response back
* [ ] This service will not have a UI, so only API endpoints will be visible
* [ ] Find something like SwaggerAPI tp show all the endpoints

## Stage 3:
* [ ] Once the repository has enough information, make it public with wiki pages enabled and all the information transferred
* [ ] Make this repository public and add it as a SpringBoot experience section for future employers
