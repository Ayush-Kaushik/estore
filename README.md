# Basic CRM RoadMap (Spring Boot)
_________________________________

## Stage 1
* [x] Setup directory structure for Java application
* [x] Set up gradle
* [ ] document the setup process
* [x] Add a test endpoint
* [ ] Document the entire process in wiki page of this repository
* [x] Setup a simple database table
* [x] Make connection to the database
* [ ] Understand components of Spring-bbot application
* [ ] Connect this to Github actions to build an executable (https://tomgregory.com/build-gradle-projects-with-github-actions/) - Document this process


## Stage 2:
* [x] Create CRUD based endpoints and send test response back
* [ ] This service will not have a UI, so only API endpoints will be visible
* [ ] Find something like SwaggerAPI tp show all the endpoints
* [ ] Add validation to the endpoints


## Stage 3:
* [ ] Once the repository has enough information, make it public with wiki pages enabled and all the information transferred
* [ ] Make this repository public and add it as a SpringBoot experience section for future employers
* [ ] Add authentication and authorization workflow
* [ ] Learn how to use profiler for performance
* [ ] Learn how load testing can be performed
* [ ] Check if multi-threading is possible in this process
